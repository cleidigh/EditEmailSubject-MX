# ![EESMX icon]  EditEmailSubject MX
## MailExtension Conversion Project

The original EditEmailSubject was a legacy [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/) add-on for Thunderbird 68 written by jisse44, that allowed users to change the subject header for any e-mail that is displayed to the user.

The extension in this repository is based on the work of jisse44. We updated the code to be a pure MailExtension (EditEmailSubject MX) with the goal of providing tips and conversion notes for other developers, to outline how to migrate legacy add-ons to WebExtension add-ons.

## Releases & Changelog
EditEmailSubject-MX releases can be found [here](https://github.com/cleidigh/EditEmailSubject-MX/releases). Each release will list the relevant changes and provides a link to an XPI file to download the add-on. 

_Note: You need to save the XPI file on your computer (using "save as" from the context menu). If you just click on it, it will be installed in your Firefox browser where it will not work of course. The downloaded file can be installed in Thunderbird using the gear menu in the Add-On Manager._

_Alternatively use Drag&Drop for installing from "Releases" directly to the TB/Addon Manager page. With having both pages open just grap the release in question on github and drag it over to the TB page, release and follow further instructions._
